Our staff follow very detailed guidelines to make sure we provide world class service. Therefore, you can rest assured that your premises receive cleaning backed by the expertise of our employees perfected through decades of service.

 

Residential cleaning

We’ll make sure your new residence is sparklingly clean or that your old one is tidy enough to leave a good impression. Your cleaner will sanitize every nook and cranny, ensuring everything is spotless.

 

Commercial Cleaning
It is a well-known fact that a clean work space not only provides a safer working environment but also promotes productivity. We offer professional and quality commercial janitorial services which include vacuuming, dusting, basic sanitizing, trash pick-up and routine deep cleaning. Whether it’s your office space, warehouse, kitchenettes, common areas or washrooms, we’ve got a customized cleaning solution for you.

 

Post-Construction Cleaning
This can be tedious, time consuming work with dust and debris everywhere. Book our team of trained professionals to get your new space tidy and livable. This will give you time to focus on your other tasks such as furnishings, interior décor, and more while our cleaning stewards get the area ready for your ideas. There are two ways we can help you during new constructions. Our professional cleaners can work alongside your team throughout the building process so that we can clean as we go. Or we can wait until the completion of your project to do a full cleanup. Whatever your preference, we’ve got you fully covered.
